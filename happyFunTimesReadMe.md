The Idea of Markdown files is to make it easier to write text that you want too have some sort of richness to it, but don't want 
to get hung up on details of markup (HTML) or having to resort to more binary representation such as in MS word

Markdown can produce lists, just like this:
- A list Item can start with either a dash or an assterix
	- It's  a good idea to be consistent 
	- This lin, and the one above are indented in the list
- Unordered lists are easy to do in MD
-Besides unordered lists. you can do ordered lists/ for an ordered list use the number 1 followed by a dot
